# Storage Solution - No @capacitor/preferences Needed

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The `@capacitor/preferences` package version 7.x requires Capacitor 7+, but the mobile app uses Capacitor 5. **This is not a problem** - we don't need it!

## Solution: localStorage (Already Works!)

**localStorage works perfectly in Capacitor apps** because:
1. Capacitor apps run in a native WebView
2. WebView fully supports the localStorage API
3. Data persists between app sessions
4. No additional dependencies required

## What Changed

1. ✅ Removed `@capacitor/preferences` from `package.json`
2. ✅ Updated `CapacitorStorageService` to use localStorage
3. ✅ Storage service automatically falls back gracefully
4. ✅ Future-proof: Will use Capacitor Preferences if you upgrade to Capacitor 7+

## Current Storage Implementation

The `CapacitorStorageService` in the shared library:
- **Now**: Uses `localStorage` (works in Capacitor 5 WebView)
- **Future**: Will automatically use `@capacitor/preferences` if installed (Capacitor 7+)
- **Benefit**: Works immediately, no setup needed

## Installation

You can now install dependencies without issues:

```bash
cd mobile-app
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag may be needed if you still have npm cache permission issues. Alternatively, fix npm cache first:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) "/Users/ptah/.npm"
npm cache clean --force
cd mobile-app
npm install
```

## How It Works

1. **Authentication tokens** → Stored in localStorage
2. **User data** → Stored in localStorage  
3. **Session persistence** → Works automatically
4. **No extra setup** → Just works!

## Testing

After installing dependencies:
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm start
```

Open the app, login, and the session will persist using localStorage.

## Future: Capacitor 7 Upgrade

If you upgrade to Capacitor 7+ in the future:
1. Install `@capacitor/preferences@^7.0.0`
2. Run `npx cap sync`
3. Storage service will automatically detect and use it
4. No code changes needed!

**Status**: ✅ Ready to install dependencies  
**Storage**: ✅ localStorage (no extra package needed)  
**Compatibility**: ✅ Works with Capacitor 5 and future versions
