# NG0203 Error Fix - Dependency Injection Issue

## Problem
Error code NG0203 means Angular can't find a required dependency (likely `StorageService` or `ConfigService` when `AuthService` tries to inject them).

## Root Cause
When lazy-loaded modules use the `authGuard`, the dependency injection might fail because:
1. `AuthService` has `providedIn: 'root'` and depends on `StorageService` and `ConfigService`
2. These services are provided via `provideMobileAuthServices` in `AppModule`
3. Lazy-loaded modules might not have proper access to root injector dependencies

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Comprehensive Logging
- `🔐 [AUTH]` - AuthService lifecycle
- `🔧 [PROVIDERS]` - Provider setup and creation
- `🔒 [GUARD]` - Guard execution and dependency injection

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Guard now catches injection errors and logs them
- AuthService logs when dependencies are injected
- Providers log when they're created

## Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Ensure Providers Are Available (Current Setup)
The current setup should work. Check logs to see:
- Are providers being created? (Look for `🔧 [PROVIDERS]`)
- Is AuthService being constructed? (Look for `🔐 [AUTH]`)
- Which dependency fails? (Check `🔒 [GUARD]` error logs)

### Option 2: Provide Services in Root Module Explicitly
If lazy modules still can't access them, we might need to ensure they're in root injector:

```typescript
// In app.module.ts, make sure providers are in root scope
providers: [
  // These should be available to all modules
  ...provideMobileAuthServices({...})
]
```

### Option 3: Use InjectionToken for Config (Alternative)
If ConfigService injection is the issue, we could use an InjectionToken instead of abstract class.

## Debugging with Logs

When you run the app, look for this sequence:

1. **Module Construction:**
   ```
   📦 [MODULE] AppModule constructed
   🔧 [PROVIDERS] Setting up mobile auth services
   🔧 [PROVIDERS] Creating MobileConfigService
   ```

2. **AuthService Creation:**
   ```
   🔐 [AUTH] AuthService constructor called
   🔐 [AUTH] StorageService provided: true
   🔐 [AUTH] ConfigService provided: true
   ```

3. **Guard Execution:**
   ```
   🔒 [GUARD] authGuard called
   🔒 [GUARD] AuthService injected successfully
   🔒 [GUARD] Router injected successfully
   ```

If any step fails, you'll see an error with details about which dependency is missing.

## Quick Fix to Test

If the error persists, temporarily remove the guard from routes to see if the app loads:

```typescript
// In app-routing.module.ts, comment out canActivate temporarily
{
  path: 'tabs',
  loadChildren: () => import('./tabs/tabs.module').then(m => m.TabsPageModule),
  // canActivate: [authGuard]  // Temporarily disabled
}
```

If the app loads without the guard, the issue is definitely with dependency injection in the guard.

**Current Status**: Logging added. Rebuild and check Xcode console to see exactly where dependency injection fails.
