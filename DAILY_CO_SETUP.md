## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Daily.co API key not configured"**
   - Ensure `DAILY_API_KEY` environment variable is set
   - Restart your backend server after adding the environment variable

2. **"Failed to create Daily.co room"**
   - Check your API key is valid and has proper permissions
   - Verify your Daily.co account is active

3. **Video call window doesn't open**
   - Check browser popup blockers
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

4. **Can't join video call**
   - Verify the meeting is scheduled in the future
   - Check your internet connection

5. **Theme configuration error**
   - If you see "unsupported theme configuration" errors, the theme has been fixed to use the correct "colors" property
   - Refresh the page and try again

6. **Token validation error**
   - If you see "token should be a string" errors, the token handling has been improved
   - The system now properly validates and formats tokens before passing to Daily.co
   - Check the browser console for detailed token information

7. **URL property error**
   - If you see "url property isn't set" errors, the URL is now properly set in the iframe configuration
   - The system validates room URLs before attempting to create video calls
   - Check that the backend is properly generating Daily.co room URLs

8. **Empty room URL error**
   - If you see "Room URL is empty or invalid" errors, the system now automatically falls back to Jitsi Meet
   - This happens when Daily.co API is not configured or room creation fails
   - The system will generate a Jitsi room URL as a fallback to ensure video calls still work

9. **Video call stuck on "Connecting"**
   - If the video call modal shows "Connecting to video call..." indefinitely, the system now has timeout mechanisms
   - After 30 seconds, it will show an error with troubleshooting steps
   - The system automatically falls back to Jitsi if Daily.co fails to initialize
   - Check browser permissions for camera/microphone access

10. **Daily.co URL property error**
    - If you see "url property isn't set" errors, the system now has enhanced URL validation
    - The frontend automatically falls back to Jitsi Meet if Daily.co URL is empty
    - Enhanced debugging logs help identify URL generation issues
    - Automatic fallback ensures video calls always work regardless of backend configuration

11. **Platform mismatch error**
    - If you see Daily.co trying to load Jitsi URLs, the system now detects the actual platform from the URL
    - The frontend checks if the URL contains 'daily.co' or 'meet.jit.si' to determine the correct method
    - Backend now properly reports the actual platform being used based on the generated URL
    - Enhanced platform detection prevents mismatched video call methods

12. **Media permissions**
    - The system now requests camera and microphone permissions upfront for better user experience
    - Permission status is shown in the loading screen with color-coded feedback
    - Users receive clear notifications about permission status
    - Automatic permission requests prevent video call delays and improve connection reliability
